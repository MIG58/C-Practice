/**
 * 2. Write a program in C to demonstrate how to handle the pointers in the program.
 Expected Output :

 Address of m : 0x7ffcc3ad291c
 Value of m : 29

 Now ab is assigned with the address of m.
 Address of pointer ab : 0x7ffcc3ad291c
 Content of pointer ab : 29

 The value of m assigned to 34 now.
 Address of pointer ab : 0x7ffcc3ad291c
 Content of pointer ab : 34

 The pointer variable ab is assigned with the value 7 now.
 Address of m : 0x7ffcc3ad291c
 Value of m : 7
