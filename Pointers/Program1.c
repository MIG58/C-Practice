/**
 * Program to Understand &,*,sizeof() operators use in pointers
 *
 *  &  (address of Operator)
 * To access address of a variable to a pointer,
 *  we use the unary operator & (ampersand) that returns the address of that variable.
 *  For example &x gives us address of variable x.
 *
 *  * (value at address Operator / Indirection Operator)
 *  It is a unary * (Asterisk) operator which is used for two things :
 *
 *     1. To declare a pointer variable.
 *         (When a pointer variable is declared in C/C++, there must be a * before its name.)
 *
 *          Example -
 *              int *ptr; //declaration
 *
 *     2. To access the value stored in the address we use the unary operator (*) that returns the value of the variable
 *        located at the address specified by its operand. This is also called Dereferencing.
 *
 *        Example - (Full Pointer & Normal Variable working)
 *
 *        int v=23,*ptr;   // Assume address of v is (0x33)
 *                         // Assume address of *ptr is (0xFF)
 *        ptr = &v;
 *
 *        print( v )      23
 *        print( &v )     0x33
 *        print( *(&v) )  23 // "pointer dereferencing" ( {&v}=address of v | *{ }= value of address {&v} of v )
 *        print( &(*v) )  Error because v is not a pointer type variable
 *
 *        print(ptr)  (0x33)
 *        print(*ptr)  23
 *        print(&ptr)  0xFF (pointer self address)
 *
 *        print( &(*ptr) )  0xFF  (Address of variable pointing -> 0xFF[v] )
 *        print( *(&ptr) )  0xFF  (Address of variable pointing -> 0xFF[v] ) Dereferencing pointer
 *
 *        print(*&*&*&*&*&*&*ptr) // Value of variable V through pointer
 *        print(&*&*&*&*&*&*&*ptr) // Address of variable V through pointer
 *
 *         Hence in terms of pointer variable " &(*ptr) or *(&ptr) " both are same
 *
 *         De-referencing a pointer means fetch the value stored in the pointer *&age
